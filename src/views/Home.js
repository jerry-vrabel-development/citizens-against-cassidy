      <h1>District 14 of The Illinois House deserve better representation.</h1>
      <p>We intend to build a Grassroots Campaign from local volunteers,
         activists, and community leaders to spread a better message.
         We want to elect a representative who will fight for healthcare rights, labor rights, housing rights, the people's rights of District 14.
      </p>
      <p>We intend to engage with the community: Spend time with constituents, understanding their needs, grievances, and aspirations. Kelly Cassidy has become disconnected from our district, and her base does not represent the diversities of our neighborhoods.</p>  
      <p>We will have a digital presence: In today's age, a strong digital and social media presence is essential. We will engage, inform, and activate voters through our progressive platforms.</p>
